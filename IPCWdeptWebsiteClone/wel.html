<h1>DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1></header>
<p>The Department of Computer Science, Indraprastha College for Women was started in 1997 and  offers one of the most coveted four-year undergraduate degree programs in computer science, i.e., B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Science and B.A. (Program) with Computer Science under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The new curriculum aims to develop core competencies in computing and problem-solving among its graduates. The curriculum thus focuses on building theoretical foundations in computer science to enable its pupils to think critically when challenged with totally different and new problems. These courses are open to students from all academic backgrounds and do not require any prerequisite knowledge. Being a women-only institution, this is an excellent step towards empowering young women with the latest technical education.  The Department also offers generic elective papers (GE), skill enhancement papers (SEC), and value addition courses (VAC) introduced under the National Education Policy.</p>


<p>The courses cover all aspects, from the fundamentals such as Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Databases, and Computer Networks to advanced courses such as Machine Learning, Data Mining, Security, Microprocessors, Advanced algorithms, etc. This way, the course prepares the students for higher education. Some new papers, such as Mathematics for Computing, Probability for Computing, Numerical Optimization, etc., have also been introduced as part of the National Education Policy. With the option to obtain specialization in an area of their choice, the curriculum prepares the students to take up research projects in their final year. There are many options available for the students after completing this course. They can take up the placements offered to them through campus placements.  The students can also enroll for M.Sc.(CS)/MCA, M.Sc. (OR), and M.Sc. (Informatics) courses after completing B.Sc. (H) Computer Science. In the M.Sc. Computer Science course of the University of Delhi, about 50% of the seats are filled on the basis of merit in the B.Sc. (H) Computer Science examination of the University of Delhi. Many students also enroll in MBA courses after graduating from this course.</p>


<p>The Department of Computer Science has excellent infrastructure in the form of a dedicated computer science block with air-conditioned computer labs equipped with the latest computer systems, printers, and round-the-clock internet facilities. These systems are updated/ replaced from time to time to keep up with the latest technology. All the labs are equipped with projectors for an effective teaching-learning experience.</p> 


<p>The Department has a strength of 15 faculty members that includes one professor, Prof. Archana Singhal, five Associate Professors Dr. Ritu Singhal, Dr. Manisha Bansal, Dr. Manju Bala, Mrs. Vimala Parihar and Dr. Sarabjeet Kaur (teacher-in-charge for the academic year 2023-24) and nine Assistant Professors. All the faculty members are highly qualified and dedicated to imparting quality education. The faculty has interests in varied research fields ranging from Theoretical Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Data Mining, Pattern Recognition to Software Engineering. </p>


<p>Several well-known IT companies like Wipro Technologies, CDAC, Tenet Computer and Communication Pvt. Ltd., Infiwave Solutions, Galytix, Kyndryl, TravClan, Wipro Ltd., Kaseya, D. E. Shaw India Pvt. Ltd., etc. visit the campus for recruitment. A few students have recently bagged job offers with a whopping-high package of 18 lacs per annum.</p> 


<p>A large number of alumnae have gained prestigious positions in academia and industry, such as Sq. Ldr. Saumya Singh, Indian Air Force, Dr. Aneesha Sethi, Senior Cyber Security Consultant, ServiceNow, London, United Kingdom; and Ms. Archi Mittal, Vice President, Goldman Sachs. The Department makes continuous efforts to maintain its connection with its illustrious alumni.</p> 


<p>Apart from the core curriculum prescribed by the university, various co-curricular activities are conducted throughout the year to make the students future ready. These include soft skills training, technical and aptitude test preparations, seminars by leading IT experts, project mentorship by illustrious alumni, and others. The Department also fosters a research culture at the undergraduate level by holding departmental research seminars regularly. As a result, many students have presented and published research papers at international conferences and in prestigious journals.</p><br>
